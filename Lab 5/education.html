                <p>
                    My favourite class is CS-546 Web Prograamimg. This is one of the favourite class till now I have attended. This course has very interesting assignments. I do not miss a single class because professor has great knowledge. I am learning many new things from this course. I like the way professor teach new concept.

                    Memorable memory: My first day at stevens was interesting. I was new at stevens and did not know about the location of building. I got lost and could not able to reach on time for my orientation. Later on I studied the map of stevens. Now I easily figure out each building.

                    <h2>Babaria Institute of Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                            My most loved class at Babaria was my Public Speaking class with Kari Duffy. She made a casual environment that enabled the understudies to feel good making inquiries, and all the more critically, getting up before the class to give a discourse. Not exclusively were extraordinary, entertaining recollections made with my kindred colleagues, yet the course additionally showed me how to viably display a contention in a verbal way, a quality that is useful for any vocation way.

                            Memorable Memory: Our college used to organise a cultural festival every year in the month of February called 'Surge'. This festival used to have a number of events related to dance, music, singing, sports and also a DJ night. I used to enjoy going to this festival with my friends. This is one my most memorable memory from my undergraduate college.
